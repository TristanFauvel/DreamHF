##Summary Sentence
*(suggested limit 30 words)*

A Cox Proportional Hazards model based on selected clinical covariates and gut microbiome alpha diversity to predict the risk of heart failure.

##Background/Introduction
*(suggested limit 200 words)*

Please try to address the following points:
* What is the motivation for your approach?  This will include any previous work and observations that you have made about the data to suggest your approach is a good one.  Provide the reader with an intuition of how you approached the problem
* What is the underlying methodology used (e.g., SVM or regression)?
* Where there any novel approaches taken in regards to feature selection, data imputation, ranking, etc?

##Methods
*(suggested limit 800 words)*

The methods should cover a full description of your methods so a reader can reproduce them.  Please cover how you processed the data, if any data was imputed or manipulated in any way (e.g., you mapped data onto pathways or combined different datasets), the underlying algorithm, any modifications to the underlying method of importance, the incorporation of outside data, and the approach to predict submitted data.
If you submitted multiple predictions, please specify which is the difference among them (e.g. only parameters tuning or different algorithms). If needed, you can decide to write one sub-paragraph for each submission.

##Conclusion/Discussion
*(suggested limit 200 words)*

This section should include a short summary and any insights gained during the algorithm.  For example, which dataset was most informative?  You can include future directions.  You may also add some discussion on the general performance of your methodology (if you wish) and if there were pitfalls, what are they?

##References
*(suggested limit 10 references)*
